The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced an infection prevention and control (IPC) framework to mitigate the impact of HAIs, crucial for ensuring patient safety in hospitals. HAIs acquired after hospitalization pose significant challenges due to factors such as compromised immunity, invasive medical procedures, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which have dire consequences, including higher mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are critical in implementing IPC measures. Infection control programs that include strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, and surveillance have become standard. However, challenges such as resistance to change, resource limitations, patient turnover, and variability in patient conditions persist. Strategies to maintain hospital infection control involve rigorous compliance monitoring, staff education, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), telemedicine, and innovative sanitation methods. The future of hospital infection control may involve increased integration of environmental monitoring, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient participation while leveraging collaboration among healthcare facilities.

While the main application of psychotherapy is psychological disorders, recent studies have found that it is beneficial for somatic and physiological symptoms such as chronic pain or even irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Irritable bowel syndrome is a common but debilitating gastrointestinal condition that has a prevalence of 12% in the United States and costs the average patient $9,776 annually in 2023. Irritatable bowel syndrome is a condition of exclusion but consists of abdominal discomfort or pain and must be associated with altered bowel habits as stated in the Rome IV criteria. At least half of these patients also exhibit extracolonic symptoms, most commonly psychological disorders like anxiety and stress. The true etiology of IBS is not understood, but ideas such as the brain-gut axis, stress response system, and gut microbiota have been evaluated. Treatment of IBS is extensive and heavily relies on the patient-physician interaction, but pharmacologic therapies have been employed and are sometimes unsuccessful. Irritable bowel syndrome impacts an individual as a whole, making them hesitate whether or not they eat a particular food or even go out to do an activity because of the unpredictable bowel pattern. Finding a better solution is essential to improving the patient's quality of life (QoL), especially by addressing how they perceive the illness, how they adjust to it, and even how they determine what foods to consume.

These subtypes can be distinguished by the distinct markings left by metabolites, proteins, miRNA, and DNA. Personalized illness management may be possible if cancer is categorized according to its biomarkers. In order to stop cancer from spreading and posing a significant risk to patient survival, early detection and prompt treatment are essential. Traditional cancer screening techniques are tedious, time-consuming, and require expert personnel for analysis. This has led scientists to reevaluate screening methodologies and make use of emerging technologies to achieve better results. Using time and money saving techniques, these methodologies integrate the procedures from sample preparation to detection in small devices with high accuracy and sensitivity. With its proven potential for biomedical use, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been widely used in biosensing applications, particularly in biomarker identification. Consideration was given especially to the potential of SERS as a portable clinical diagnostic tool. The approaches to SERS-based sensing technologies for both invasive and non-invasive samples are reviewed in this article, along with sample preparation techniques and obstacles. Aside from these significant constraints in the detection approach and techniques, the review also takes into account the complexity of biological fluids, the availability of biomarkers, and their sensitivity and selectivity, which are generally lowered. Massive ways to maintain sensing capabilities in clinical samples are being developed recently to get over this restriction. SERS is known to be a reliable diagnostic method for treatment judgments. Nonetheless, there is still room for advancement in terms of portability, creation of diagnostic apps, and interdisciplinary AI-based applications.

This microbiome is essential for physiological functions such as digestion, immunity, metabolism, and structural integrity, and\u00a0of prime concern to us in conducting this study is the nervous system communication. This two-way communication between the GIT and central nervous system (CNS) is known as the gut-brain axis (GBA) and has implications for neurocritical disease. A change in any factor relating to this microbiome is known as gut dysbiosis; this can lead to aberrant communication through the GBA and in turn, can contribute to disease states. The primary objective\u00a0of this study is to determine the cause-specific dysbiotic organisms in neuro-critically ill patients and their effects. We performed this study by searching published literature as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that defined gastrointestinal dysbiosis in neuro-critically ill patients were retrieved using Boolean search from 2000 to 2023 via PubMed and Google Scholar and narrowed the results down to five prospective\u00a0case-control studies. We performed their quality assessment. The results concluded\u00a0that in neurocritical illnesses such as encephalitis, brain tumors, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke, fluctuations in specific microbiota correlated with disease severity and prognosis. Moreover, the inhabiting population of dysbiotic organisms in neuro-critically ill patients were different in different diseases and there were no similarities in the composition of gut microbiota in these diseases.\u00a0Taking stroke patients as an example; increased Enterobacteriaceae and lower Lachnospiraceae microbiome levels were found in patients with a higher stroke dysbiosis index (SDI). Those patients who developed stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) displayed higher levels of Enterococcus species.

A promising method to balance carbon levels and mitigate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise is through photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), renowned for its affordability, stability, availability, and eco-friendliness, stands out as an exemplary catalyst in photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Various strategies have been proposed to modify TiO<sub>2</sub> for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and improve catalytic activity and product selectivity. However, few studies have systematically summarized these strategies and analyzed their advantages, disadvantages, and current progress. Here, we comprehensively review recent advancements in TiO<sub>2</sub> engineering, focusing on crystal engineering, interface design, and reactive site construction to enhance photocatalytic efficiency and product selectivity. We discuss how modifications in TiO<sub>2</sub>'s optical characteristics, carrier migration, and active site design have led to varied and selective CO<sub>2</sub> reduction products. These enhancements are thoroughly analyzed through experimental data and theoretical calculations. Additionally, we identify current challenges and suggest future research directions, emphasizing the role of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials in understanding photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction mechanisms and in designing effective catalysts. This review is expected to contribute to the global pursuit of carbon neutrality by providing foundational insights into the mechanisms of photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials and guiding the development of efficient photocatalysts.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Lesion voxels to lesion networks: The enduring value of the Vietnam Head Injury Study.", "article_abstract": "The Vietnam Head Injury Study has been curated by Dr Jordan Grafman since the 1980s in an effort to study patients with penetrating traumatic brain injuries suffered during the Vietnam War. Unlike many datasets of ischemic stroke lesions, the VHIS collected extraordinarily deep phenotyping and was able to sample lesion locations that are not constrained to typical vascular territories. For decades, this dataset has helped researchers draw causal links between neuroanatomical regions and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The value of the VHIS has only increased over time as techniques for analyzing the dataset have developed and evolved. Tools such as voxel lesion symptom mapping allowed one to relate symptoms to individual brain voxels. With the advent of the human connectome, tools such as lesion network mapping allow one to relate symptoms to connected brain networks by combining lesion datasets with new atlases of human brain connectivity. In a series of recent studies, lesion network mapping has been combined with the Vietnam Head Injury dataset to identify brain networks associated with spirituality, religiosity, consciousness, memory, emotion regulation, addiction, depression, and even transdiagnostic mental illness. These findings are enhancing our ability to make diagnoses, identify potential treatment targets for focal brain stimulation, and understand the human brain generally. Our techniques for studying brain lesions will continue to improve, as will our tools for modulating brain circuits. As these advances occur, the value of well characterized lesion datasets such as the Vietnam Head Injury Study will continue to grow.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of CO therapy is inhibited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to construct hollow-structured rough nanoplatforms to boost antitumor immunity and simultaneously reverse immunosuppression by exploring intrinsic immunomodulatory properties and morphological optimization of nanomaterials. The TME-responsive delivery nanosystems (M-RMH) are developed by encapsulating the CO prodrug within hollow rough MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and the subsequent surface functionalization with hyaluronic acid (HA). Rough surfaces are designed to facilitate the intrinsic properties of HA-functionalized MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (RMH) to induce dendritic cell maturation and M1 macrophage polarization by STING pathway activation and hypoxia alleviation through enhanced cellular uptake. After TME-responsive degradation of RMH, controlled release of CO is triggered at the tumor site for CO therapy to activate antitumor immunity. More importantly, RMH could modulate immunosuppressive TME by hypoxia alleviation. After the combination with aPD-L1-mediated checkpoint blockade therapy, robust antitumor immune responses are found to inhibit both primary and distant tumors.

Climate factors, such as temperature and rainfall patterns, play a crucial role in the transmission dynamics of the disease. This study presents a deterministic model that aims to evaluate the temporal and seasonal transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis by examining the influence of temperature and rainfall over time. Equilibrium states are examined to ascertain their existence and stability employing the center manifold theory, while the basic reproduction number is calculated using the next-generation technique. To validate the model's applicability, demographic and climatological data from Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, which are endemic East African countries situated in the tropical region, are utilized as a case study region. The findings of this study provide evidence that the transmission of schistosomiasis in human populations is significantly influenced by seasonal and monthly variations, with incidence rates varying across countries depending on the frequency of temperature and rainfall. Consequently, the region is marked by both schistosomiasis emergencies and re-emergences. Specifically, it is observed that monthly mean temperatures within the range of 22-27\u00a0\u00b0C create favorable conditions for the development of schistosomiasis and have a positive impact on the reproduction numbers. On the other hand, monthly maximum temperatures ranging from 27 to 33\u00a0\u00b0C have an adverse effect on transmission. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, it is projected that by the year 2050, factors such as the recruitment rate of snails, the presence of parasite egg-containing stools, and the rate of miracidia shedding per parasite egg will contribute significantly to the occurrence and control of schistosomiasis infections. This study highlights the significant influence of seasonal and monthly variations, driven by temperature and rainfall patterns, on the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis. These findings underscore the importance of considering climate factors in the control and prevention strategies of schistosomiasis.

Since OI is commonly caused by single-nucleotide mutation(s) in the <i>COL1A1</i> or <i>COL1A2</i> genes encoding\u00a0type I collagens, we developed a genome-editing strategy to correct a <i>Col1a2</i> mutation in an OIM mouse model resembling a severe dominant form of human type III OI. Using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), we delivered CRISPR-Cas9 to bone-forming osteoblast-lineage cells in the skeleton. Homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated gene editing efficiency in these cells was improved when CRISPR-Cas9 was coupled with a donor AAV vector containing a promoterless partial mouse <i>Col1a2</i> complementary DNA sequence. This approach effectively reversed the dysregulation of osteogenic differentiation by a <i>Col1a2</i> mutation <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>. Furthermore, systemic administration of dual rAAVs in OIM mice lowered bone matrix turnover rates by reducing osteoblast and osteoclast development while improving the cellular network of mechano-sensing osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix. This strategy significantly improved bone architecture/mass/mineralization, skeletal deformities, grip strength, and spontaneous fractures. Our study is the first demonstration that HDR-mediated gene editing via AAV-mediated delivery effectively corrects a collagen mutation in OI osteoblasts and reverses skeletal phenotypes in OIM mice.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "26"}}, {"article_title": "NeuroD1 Regulated Endothelial Gene Expression to Modulate Transduction of AAV-PHP.eB and Recovery Progress after Ischemic Stroke.", "article_abstract": "AAV-PHP.eB depends on endothelial cells to highly transduce the central nervous system (CNS) and is widely used for intravenous gene therapy. However, the transduction profile and therapeutic efficiency after endothelial cell injury such as ischemic stroke is largely unknown. In this study, we tested the transduction profiles of AAV-PHP.eB and developed intravenous NeuroD1 gene therapy to treat ischemic stroke in mice. We found that AAV-PHP.eB-GFP control virus crossed the BBB and infected brain cells efficiently in normal brain. However, after stroke, AAV-PHP.eB-GFP control virus was highly restricted in the blood vessels. Surprisingly, after switching to therapeutic vector AAV-PHP.eB-NeuroD1-GFP, the viral vector successfully crossed blood vessels and infected brain cells. Using Tie2-cre transgenic mice, we demonstrated that NeuroD1 regulated endothelial gene expression to modulate AAV-PHP.eB transduction. Following the changes of signaling pathways in endothelial cells, NeuroD1 effectively protected BBB integrity, attenuated neuroinflammation, inhibited neuron apoptosis and rescued motor deficits after ischemic stroke. Moreover, NeuroD1 over-expression in brain cells further promoted neural regeneration. These results indicate that intravenous gene therapy using AAV-PHP.eB for ischemic stroke differs from intracranial gene therapy and NeuroD1 intravenous delivery using AAV-PHP.eB efficiently rescue both vascular damage and neuronal loss, providing an advancing therapeutic treatment for stroke.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Multimodal Imaging Findings Associated With Cardiac Oxalosis Cardiomyopathy.", "article_abstract": "We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with secondary oxalosis following bowel resection resulting in restrictive cardiomyopathy and a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis based on the initial workup.

The U.S. Army asked RAND Arroyo Center to examine the use of VBH to inform recommendations on the role of VBH care in the future of BH care in the Military Health System. The authors analyzed administrative data on VBH and in-person BH care from prior to the pandemic through March 2022 and surveyed soldiers who received BH care to assess their perceptions of VBH care. Administrative data analyses showed that direct care providers were less likely to deliver VBH care than private-sector providers and relied heavily on audio rather than video VBH. In addition, soldiers who received VBH care typically received a mix of VBH and in-person visits. Survey respondents who used VBH care had similar perceptions of the quality of their care and more-positive views of VBH than respondents who did not use VBH care.

Consistently, mutations to the TORC1 subunit RAPTOR/Mip1 and the TORC1 substrate Sck1 significantly improve cellular heat resistance, suggesting that TORC1 restricts fission yeast growth at high temperatures. Aiming for a more comprehensive understanding of the negative regulation of high-temperature growth, we conducted genome-wide screens, which identified additional factors that suppress cell proliferation at high temperatures. Among them is Mks1, which is phosphorylated in a TORC1-dependent manner, forms a complex with the 14-3-3 protein Rad24, and suppresses the high-temperature growth independently of Sck1.

Among the various types of ovarian cancer, clear cell carcinoma has a poor prognosis due to its malignant potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) regulate gene expression in cells by suppressing the translation of target genes or by degrading the target mRNA. miRNAs are also secreted from the cells in the blood, binding to proteins or lipids and assisting in cell-cell communication. Therefore, serum miRNAs may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The present study investigated and identified specific miRNAs associated with ovarian clear cell carcinoma and compared them to those in ovarian endometrioma samples and healthy controls. CA125, an ovarian tumor marker, did not differ between patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma, endometriosis or healthy controls. Subsequently, four miRNAs (miR-146a-5p, miR-191-5p, miR-484 and miR-574-3p) were analyzed. The expression levels of miR-146a-5p and miR-191-5p were significantly increased in the serum samples from patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma compared with those in the healthy controls, but there was no significant difference compared with in patients with endometriosis.

Result showed that the highest monthly mean confirmed cases (56) and mortality (9) from LF were reported in February. The first quarter of the year reported the highest cases of both confirmed cases and deaths in Nigeria. Result also revealed that for the confirmed cases, quantile regression at 50% outperformed the best of the MLM, Gaussian-matern5/2 GPR (RMSE=10.3393 vs. 11.615), while for mortality, the medium Gaussian SVM (RMSE=1.6441 vs. 1.8352) outperformed QRM.

Acetone extraction strengthened the formation of hydroxymethyl-<i>L</i>-furfural that was higher when compared to acidified 50% ethanol, while trace amounts were reported for non-acidified counterpart. Similar observation was made in the case of flavan-3-ols. Addition of carriers during powders production led to the lower hydroxymethyl-<i>L</i>-furfural formation even down to 74% with regard to carrier-free samples.

Current serological screening methods require access to a well-equipped laboratory and are not currently available for on-site analysis. As a proof of concept, we propose here a species-independent lateral flow microarray immunoassay (LMIA) able to quickly detect and distinguish between WNV Non-Structural 1 (NS1) and USUV NS1-specific antibodies. A double antigen approach was used to test sera collected from humans, horses, European jackdaws (<i>Corvus monedula)</i>, and common blackbirds (<i>Turdus merula)</i>. Optimization of the concentration of capture antigen spotted on the LMIA membrane and the amount of detection antigen conjugated to detector particles indicated that maximizing both parameters increased assay sensitivity. Upon screening of a larger serum panel, the optimized LMIA showed significantly higher spot intensity for a homologous binding event. Using a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, WNV NS1 LMIA results in humans, horses, and <i>C. monedula</i> showed good correlation when compared to \"gold standard\" WNV FRNT90.

Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA for within-group comparison. Intergroup comparison was done using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test. Results All the groups showed a statistically significant reduction in dentin hypersensitivity (p<0.001). The reduction in\u00a0hypersensitivity in various groups can be graded as group II (3.578/1.800/1.556) > group IV (3.367/1.755/1.555) > group I (2.3781/1.022/0.822) > group III (2.222/0.911/0.778) as evaluated by tactile, air blast, and cold-graded thermal tests, respectively. Group II and group IV presented a significant reduction in sensitivity levels consistent for up to six months. Conclusion Nano-hydroxyapatite and pro-argin can be used effectively for reducing dentin hypersensitivity. Iontophoresis can be a valuable adjunct for their improved delivery, enhancing and prolonging their effectiveness.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "23"}}, {"article_title": "HS-GC-IMS and HS-SPME/GC-MS coupled with E-nose and E-tongue reveal the flavors of raw milk from different regions of China.", "article_abstract": "Milk authentication requires identification of the origin and assessment of the aroma characteristics.

The constant influx of new information about the virus created knowledge gaps, and the relentless demands of their work schedules left many feeling overwhelmed. This paper explores the knowledge, attitudes, anxiety levels, and preventive behaviors of HCWs in the twin cities of Pakistan, Rawalpindi and Islamabad, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this crisis, it is essential to gain insights into the experiences and needs of these frontline heroes. Methodology We conducted a descriptive web-based cross-sectional study among healthcare professionals to delve into the multifaceted aspects of their experiences. This included analyzing sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge levels, attitudes, practices, and the psychological implications of the pandemic. By employing both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of these parameters. Results Out of the 1150 responses collected, it became evident that breathing problems were the most recognized symptom of COVID-19 among HCWs. Impressively, 95.7% of participants believed in the primarily symptomatic nature of treatment, although 37% held the misconception that antibiotics were effective against the virus. Another noteworthy discovery was that 68.2% of HCWs favored testing before initiating treatment, yet a concerning 22.7% of treated patients received no testing. A significant proportion, approximately 19.6%, experienced heightened anxiety levels during the pandemic, leading to an increased frequency of handwashing. In terms of preventive behaviors, a majority of respondents displayed a heightened sense of caution. Nearly 59.1% reported avoiding the use of others' accessories and emphasized not reusing face masks. Furthermore, 84.1% of participants preferred staying at home during quarantine. Conclusion The study reveals the profound impact of COVID-19 on healthcare providers in Pakistan's twin cities, highlighting elevated anxiety levels among most. This underscores the urgent need for mental health support. Beyond physical effects, the pandemic significantly strains their psychological well-being. To address this stress, vital strategies include workload reduction, structured shifts, stressor minimization, and improved knowledge sharing. Cultivating a healthy work environment is equally crucial for healthcare providers' overall well-being. These insights are essential for crafting policies and interventions to better protect and support frontline workers in a developing nation like Pakistan, demonstrating healthcare professionals' resilience and dedication amid unprecedented challenges.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "Residual Neuromuscular Blockade and Postoperative Pulmonary Complications in the Post-anesthesia Care Unit: A Prospective Observational Study.", "article_abstract": "Background Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are employed during general anesthesia induction for endotracheal intubation and to facilitate specific surgeries requiring muscle relaxation. However, residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) can lead to respiratory complications in post-anesthesia care units (PACUs). This study investigates RNMB incidence in PACUs and its association with postoperative airway and respiratory issues. Methods A prospective observational study on patients undergoing general anesthesia with NMBAs was conducted at the Department of Anesthesia, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, over six months (April to September 2023). Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were calculated using an acceleromyograph upon PACU arrival. Data on demographics, perioperative variables, and postoperative complications were recorded. Results Among 82 patients, 30 (36.6%) had RNMB upon PACU arrival. RNMB incidence declined: 17.1% at 10 minutes, 6.1% at 20 minutes, and 2.4% at 30 minutes, resolving by 40 minutes. Demographics and procedure duration showed no correlation with RNMB. Postoperative respiratory complications affected 23.2% of patients, notably higher in those with RNMB (p = 0.001). Among patients with TOF <90% at PACU arrival, 46.7% experienced complications compared to 9.6% with TOF \u226590% (p<0.001). Participants without RNMB had a significantly higher weight (p = 0.046).

They occur in 7 per 100,000 individuals in the United Kingdom (UK) and are categorized into astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas in the adult population. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a classification system in order to better categorise these lesions, placing them in a range from grade I to grade IV. The higher the grade, the poorer the prognosis. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom recommends that all surgical resections of glial brain tumours are followed by a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan within a 72-hour to establish a baseline for further management. Objective We present a retrospective analysis that assessed the compliance rate with NICE guidelines among patients who underwent surgical resection of glial lesions at the Department of Neurosurgery, Queens Hospital Romford, between January 2022 and September 2023. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 136 glial tumour resections that\u00a0were performed during the period between January 2022 and September 2023. The total time between the end of the operation and the MRI scan was calculated in hours for each procedure. This was analyzed into two groups with respect to compliance with the NICE guidelines, which are within 72 hours and after 72 hours. The non-compliant group was then further investigated regarding the reason for the delay. The cost related to delays was also determined by discussion with the hospital's finance department. Results All of the procedures were followed by a post-operative MRI scan but only 88% were within the timeframe recommended by NICE guidelines. The amount of delay was calculated in hours and the reasons for these delays were identified. We created two categories for delay: requesting delays and radiology department-related delays with an almost equivalent number of delays resulting from each category. This delay has resulted in approximately \u00a319,845 of extra costs for inpatient stays. Conclusion A retrospective analysis at Queens Hospital, Romford, found good compliance with NICE guidelines for post-operative MRI scans in glial lesion resections from January 2022 to September 2023. Eighty-eight per cent\u00a0of patients received scans within 72 hours, crucial for baseline assessment. A 12% non-compliance rate revealed areas for improvement, causing \u00a319,845 in extra costs due to longer inpatient stays. Expediting scans to 36 hours could save around \u00a330,876 annually and reduce complications like infections and thromboembolism.

For the energetic processing of interstellar ice mantles inside dark, dense molecular clouds, we explore the relative importance of low-energy (<20 eV) secondary electrons-agents of radiation chemistry-and low-energy (<10 eV), nonionizing photons-instigators of photochemistry. Our calculations indicate fluxes of \u223c10<sup>2</sup> electrons cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for low-energy secondary electrons produced within interstellar ices due to attenuated Galactic cosmic-ray protons. Consequently, in certain star-forming regions where internal high-energy radiation sources produce ionization rates that are observed to be a thousand times greater than the typical interstellar Galactic ionization rate, the flux of low-energy secondary electrons should far exceed that of nonionizing photons. Because reaction cross sections can be several orders of magnitude larger for electrons than for photons, even in the absence of such enhancement, our calculations indicate that secondary low-energy (<20 eV) electrons are at least as significant as low-energy (<10 eV) nonionizing photons in the interstellar synthesis of prebiotic molecules. Most importantly, our results demonstrate the pressing need for explicitly incorporating low-energy electrons in current and future astrochemical simulations of cosmic ices.

Toward this, single guide RNAs designed to target key components of the virus-induced host RNA silencing pathway (<i>AGO2</i>, <i>DCL2</i>, <i>HEN1</i>) were inserted into TBSV-based GFP-expressing viral vectors TBSV-GFP (TG) and its P19 defective mutant TG\u0394P19.

Targeting <i>AGO2</i>, <i>DCL2</i>, or <i>HEN1</i> partially rescued the lack of GFP accumulation otherwise associated with TG\u0394P19. Since the rescue phenotypes are normally only observed in the presence of the P19 silencing suppressor, the results support that the DCL2, HEN1, and AGO2 proteins are involved in anti-TBSV RNA silencing. Additionally, we show that knockdown of the RNA silencing machinery increases cargo expression from a nonviral binary Cas9 vector. The TBSV-based gene editing technology described in this study can be adapted for transient heterologous expression, rapid gene function screens, and molecular interaction studies in many plant species considering the wide host range of TBSV.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of partial replacement of durum wheat semolina with increasing amounts of TM larvae powder (5-30%) on the techno-functional properties of the binary blends. Color, granulometry, hydration properties, pasting characteristics, spectral characteristics (FTIR), reducing sugar content, and bioactivity in terms of total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS) were assessed in the resulting blends. The increasing insect powder decreased the lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) but increased the redness (a*) of the samples. In turn, the addition of insect powder did not negatively alter the hydration properties, which were comparable to those detected for semolina. Higher amounts of insect powder led to increased protein and lipid contents, as corroborated by the FTIR spectra, and decreased pasting parameters, with stronger starch granule stability detected when 20% and 30% of insect powder were added to the formulation. Significant increases in TPC and antioxidant activity were observed with increasing amount of insect powder (up to 87%, 78%, 2-fold, 67%, for TPC, FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS, respectively, compared to semolina).

In this prospective study, 136 patients with high-energy pilon fractures who were treated with a locking plate combined with ankle arthroscopy from July 2015 to July 2020 were included. The treatment efficacy was evaluated according to the Mazur ankle function score. Serum caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of caspase-1. Additionally, demographic data and clinical characteristics, such as sex, age, intraoperative blood loss, fracture healing time, fracture classification and complications were collected and analyzed. The study revealed that the intraoperative blood loss, proportion of Ruedi-Allgower III and the serum levels of caspase-1 in the poor prognosis group were significantly higher compared with those in the good prognosis group. Additionally, patients with high-energy pilon fractures in the poor prognosis group exhibited significantly higher levels of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 serum levels at all time points in contrast to those in the good prognosis group. Spearman's analysis revealed a significant association between caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 levels and Mazur scores. Furthermore, caspase-1 could serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for poor prognosis of patients with high-energy pilon fractures. Caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, intraoperative blood loss and Ruedi-Allgower grade were the risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with high-energy pilon fractures.

Our PRISMA-guided systematic review fills a critical knowledge gap in neurosurgery by consolidating scattered data on oligodendroglioma metastases, offering pivotal insights for clinical practice and future research. A 50-year-old male patient exhibited severe headaches and dizziness, with MRI findings revealing a significant brain mass suggestive of oligodendroglioma. Consequently, the patient underwent a craniotomy procedure. After 14 years, the patient presented with weakness in both lower extremities and bladder as well as bowel dysfunction. A lumbosacral MRI of the patient revealed two intradural enhancing masses in the lumbosacral spine. Surgical resection was performed, and the characteristics were identical to those of the primary tumor. The systemic review encompassed 52 articles, covering 67 cases of extracranial metastases from oligodendroglioma. Only three cases in the literature review fulfilled the inclusion criteria, demonstrating the required molecular genetic profiles of isocitrate dehydrogenase\u200b\u200b\u200b (IDH)-mutation and chromosome\u00a01p/19q-codeletion.

As a result, the purpose of the current study is to assess the effect of dietary Spirulina platensis extract as an antibiotic alternative on Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) growth, antioxidant status, blood parameters, and cecal microorganisms. There was a total of 150 Japanese quails used in this study, divided equally among 5 experimental groups (10 birds per group with 3 replicates): group 1 (G1) received a basal diet without any S. platensis extract, group 2 (G2) received a basal diet supplemented with 1 mL S. platensis extract/kg, group 3 (G3) received a basal diet supplemented with 2 mL S. platensis extract/kg, group 4 (G4) received a basal diet supplemented with 3 mL S. platensis extract/kg, and group 5 (G5) received a basal diet supplemented with 4 mL S. platensis extract/kg from d 7 until d 35. The results showed that compared to the control birds in G1, Japanese quail supplemented with 4 mL of S. platensis extract/kg of diet (G5) had significantly better live body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, digestive enzymes, blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, lipid profile, antioxidant profile, immunological parameters, and cecal microorganism's count. There were no significant changes in the percentage of carcasses, liver,\u00a0and\u00a0total giblets among all the 5 groups. Only gizzard percentage showed a significant increase in G2 compared to birds in G1. In addition, intestinal pH showed a significant drop in G2 and G5 compared to birds in G1. After cooking the quail meat, the juiciness and tenderness increased as S. platensis extract levels increased, whereas aroma and taste declined slightly as S. platensis extract levels increased. Furthermore, when a high concentration of S. platensis extract was used, the lightness of the meat reduced while its redness and yellowness increased. The disk diffusion assay showed that S. platensis extract had significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella typhi, with inhibition zones ranging from 16 to 42 mm. This activity may be attributable to the volatile chemicals in S. platensis extract, of which Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol are the primary components. In the diet of Japanese quails, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the extract of S. platensis can be utilized as a feed additive and as an alternative to antibiotics.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "06"}}, {"article_title": "Effect of Retrograde Autologous Priming on Coagulation Assessed by Rotation Thromboelastometry in Patients Undergoing Valvular Cardiac Surgery.", "article_abstract": "To investigate the effect of retrograde autologous priming (RAP) on coagulation function using rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Cause or Coincidence: A Case of Necrotizing Pancreatitis in the Setting of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection.", "article_abstract": "This study explores a rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis induced by herpes simplex virus (HSV) in an immunocompetent adult.

Using in silico similarity-based chemoinformatics we obtained a set of 270 potential hits for TRPV2 categorized into families based on chemical nature and similarity. Docking the compounds on available rat TRPV2 structures allowed the clustering of drug families in specific ligand binding sites. Starting from a probenecid docking pose in the piperlongumine binding site and using a Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics approach we have assigned a putative probenecid binding site. In parallel, we measured the EC50 of 7 probenecid derivatives on TRPV2 expressed in <i>Pichia pastoris</i> using a novel medium-throughput Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx assay in yeast membranes together with an unbiased and unsupervised data analysis method.

Ethnomethodological enquiry, with its roots in Schutzian social phenomenology, takes as its domain, topic, and substance of study the ongoing achievement of a common-sense world between social members. Yet, dialogue between psychiatry and ethnomethodological approaches is thin. In this article, we discuss a conversation analytic approach to <i>schizophrenic</i> interaction which has generated and utilized a model of a five-world manifold to frame analyses of talk-in-interaction. 'Worlds' are conceived, after Schutz, as finite domains of meaning, and the model operates as a breach of natural attitude assumptions to examine mechanisms of the constitution of the one-world-in-common of common-sense. It is suggested that certain aspects of <i>schizophrenic</i> talk might receive account in terms of a loss of integration between these five domains of meaning. Conversation Analytic methods were applied to transcripts of audio recordings of psychiatric interviews but encountered hurdles that motivated the broadening of methodological scope. Such hurdles included a weakening of the next turn proof procedure, implicit reification of the <i>schizophrenia</i> construct, and problems of translation presented by the analyst's normative membership encountering non-normative life-worlds of <i>schizophrenic</i> experience. Strategic responses to these hurdles included exploring linkages between phenomenological psychiatry and ethnomethodological approaches, as well as an engagement of ethnomethodological self-reflection and conceptual clarification of the <i>schizophrenia</i> construct in line with Garfinkel's unique adequacy requirement. The manifold model is glossed, and interaction between two of its worlds - a world of concrete, situational immediacies and another of abstract organizations - is explored in more detail via analysis of conversational data. It is suggested that the five-world model, along with further micro-analysis of talk-in-interaction, might have implications in psychiatry for topics such as autism, double bookkeeping, concretism, theories of disturbed indexicality, and insight attribution. We conclude that the consideration of atypical interaction obliges the interaction analyst to take account of their own implicit normative world-frames and that the use of domain-specific top-down models in conjunction with the inductive approach of Conversation Analysis may extend the reach of CA to facilitate productive dialogue with other disciplines.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "19"}}, {"article_title": "Clinical efficacy and safety of microwave ablation combined with percutaneous osteoplasty for palliative treatment in pelvic osteolytic metastases.", "article_abstract": "To evaluate the impact of microwave ablation (MWA) on pain relief, quality of life, mobility, and local tumour progression in adult patients with pelvic osteolytic bone metastasis and to test the safety of MWA.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Associations between marital status and weight loss trajectories entering into early adulthood: a Teen-LABS study.", "article_abstract": "Among adolescents who underwent metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), it is unclear how relationships and specifically marital status (MS) may be associated with long-term weight loss.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "19"}}, {"article_title": "A lightweight segmentation network for endoscopic surgical instruments based on edge refinement and efficient self-attention.", "article_abstract": "In robot-assisted surgical systems, surgical instrument segmentation is a critical task that provides important information for surgeons to make informed decisions and ensure surgical safety. However, current mainstream models often lack precise segmentation edges and suffer from an excess of parameters, rendering their deployment challenging. To address these issues, this article proposes a lightweight semantic segmentation model based on edge refinement and efficient self-attention. The proposed model utilizes a lightweight densely connected network for feature extraction, which is able to extract high-quality semantic information with fewer parameters. The decoder combines a feature pyramid module with an efficient criss-cross self-attention module. This fusion integrates multi-scale data, strengthens focus on surgical instrument details, and enhances edge segmentation accuracy. To train and evaluate the proposed model, the authors developed a private dataset of endoscopic surgical instruments. It containing 1,406 images for training, 469 images for validation and 469 images for testing. The proposed model performs well on this dataset with only 466 K parameters, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 97.11%. In addition, the model was trained on public datasets Kvasir-instrument and Endovis2017. Excellent results of 93.24% and 95.83% were achieved on the indicator mIoU, respectively.

Duplex ultrasound is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment options include surgical repair, ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection, and endovascular repair. In this report, we describe a 42-year-old male who presented to our center with pulsatile swelling over the mid-lateral aspect of the left leg. The diagnosis of a large anterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm was made on clinical basis and was confirmed with computed tomography angiography. The lesion was treated endovascularly with a covered stent graft. In conclusion, this case highlights the role of endovascular therapy as a surgery-sparing and minimally invasive approach in managing traumatic peripheral arterial pseudoaneurysms with excellent clinical outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "28"}}, {"article_title": "The Psychological Impact and Suicidal Behaviour in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Four Case Reports From Oman.", "article_abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine has caused disruptions to daily social and economic activities.

Some evidence suggests that pesticides can result in alterations of the female reproductive system, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Here, we detected two fungicides, Tebuconazole (Tb) and Epoxiconazole (Epox) in the soils and waters of French area. Our hypothesis is that these two triazoles could be associated to the etiology of PCOS. We used the human KGN cell line and primary human granulosa cells (hGCs) from different group of patients: normal weight non PCOS (NW), normal weight PCOS (PCOS NW), obese (obese) and obese PCOS (PCOS obese). We exposed in vitro these cells to Tb and Epox from 0 up to 10\u00a0mM for 24 and 48\u00a0h and analysed cell viability and steroidogenesis. In hGCs NW, cell viability was reduced from 12.5\u00a0\u00b5M for Tb and 75\u00a0\u00b5M for Epox. In hGCs NW, Epox decreased progesterone (Pg) and estradiol (E2) secretions and inhibited <i>STAR</i>, <i>HSD3B</i> and <i>CYP19A1</i> mRNA expressions from 25\u00a0\u00b5M and increased <i>AHR</i> mRNA expression from 75\u00a0\u00b5M. Tb exposure also reduced steroid secretion and <i>STAR</i> and <i>CYP19A1</i> mRNA expressions and increased <i>AHR</i> mRNA expression but at cytotoxic concentrations. Silencing of <i>AHR</i> in KGN cells reduced inhibitory effects of Tb and Epox on steroid secretion. Tb and Epox exposure decreased more steroid secretion in hGCs from obese, PCOS NW and PCOS obese groups than in NW group. Moreover, we found a higher gene expression of <i>AHR</i> within these three groups. Taken together, both Epox and Tb reduced steroidogenesis in hGCs through partly AHR and Tb was more cytotoxic than Epox.

This study presents a comprehensive dataset comprising experimental investigations of fluid jet breakup phenomena under large-amplitude stimulation conditions using an industrial CIJ print-head from Markem-Imaje. Unlike previous studies, this dataset encompasses a diverse range of experimental conditions, including nine different Newtonian fluids with meticulously measured rheological properties (viscosities, surface tensions and densities). The applied stimulation amplitudes vary from 5V to 45V, representing a substantial span of excitation levels. The experimental setup captures the intricate dynamics of fluid jets subjected to these varying conditions, producing a rich collection of over 5,000 high-resolution images depicting the breakup phenomena. Each amplitude of stimulation and fluid type yields more than 55 distinct images, providing detailed insights into the evolving jet morphologies. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of the dataset, all ejection parameters are rigorously documented and included. The dataset thus serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to explore the dynamics of large-amplitude Rayleigh-Plateau instability in CIJ printing. Its comprehensiveness and diversity make it particularly suitable for the application of novel machine learning and deep-learning approaches, enabling the study of jet morphological evolution beyond the confines of classical Rayleigh's theory.

Recent trends show changes in its clinical representation and incidence, particularly with the adoption of early diagnosis using first-trimester ultrasonography, which has reduced the prevalence of classical second-trimester presentations. This study aimed to analyze the changes in clinical presentation and incidence of MP among the Saudi population over the past 30 years. Methods In this retrospective study at King Fahad University Hospital, 121 complete mole (CM) pregnancy cases diagnosed and pathologically confirmed were reviewed. This included 87 cases from 2007 to 2022 (recent group) and 34 cases from 1992 to 2006 (older group). Cases of CM diagnosed before January 1992 and other diagnoses such as PM, invasive mole, or choriocarcinoma were excluded; thus, this study is focused on CM in particular. We compared patient age, gravidity, parity, abortion history, gestational age at diagnosis, hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms, anemia symptoms, and hemoglobin levels. Classical symptoms and signs related to CM were also reviewed. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2021 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States) and presented as mean, frequency, and percentage, with chi-squared tests for categorical variables; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The incidence of CM declined from 2.1 per 1,000 deliveries to 0.9 per 1,000 deliveries. Vaginal bleeding was the most common presentation in both the older (91.9%) and recent (67.6%) groups. Hyperemesis gravidarum prevalence was similar in both groups. Theca-lutein cysts were more frequent in the older group (27.5%) than the recent group (8.8%). A significant difference was observed in the occurrence of a large-for-date uterus between the older (63.20%) and recent (23.5%) groups. Notably, 14.7% of patients in the recent group were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Anemia was present in 46 cases (52.8%) of the older group but absent in the recent group, and preeclampsia occurred in 10 cases (11.4%) of the older group but not in the recent group. Conclusions Advancements in ultrasound technology, including transvaginal probes with Doppler capabilities, have enabled earlier pregnancy diagnosis, as early as five to six weeks of gestation. Many MP are now diagnosed in the first trimester without the classic clinical symptoms or \"snow-storm\" ultrasound appearance. The availability of sensitive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin assays has led to the early termination of these pregnancies, marking a significant shift in the management of MP.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Training & development, career development, and organizational commitment as the predictor of work performance.", "article_abstract": "This study aims to justify the mediating effect of organizational commitment in the association between training and development, career development, and work performance.

Our study was conducted to highlight the phytotoxic effect of triclosan on the growth, ROS homeostasis, and detoxification metabolism of two different plant species i.e., legumes (Glycine max) and grass (Avena sativa). Moreover, we investigated the potentiality of plant growth-promoting bacteria (ST-PGPB) in mitigating the phytotoxic effect of triclosan. Triclosan induced biomass (fresh and dry weights) reduction in both plants, but to a higher extent in oats. This decline was associated with a noticeable increment in the oxidative damage (e.g., MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and detoxification metabolites such as metallothionein (MTC), phytochelatins (PCs), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This elevation was associated with a remarkable reduction in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. On the other hand, the bioactive strain of ST-PGPB, Salinicoccus sp. JzA1 significantly alleviated the harmful effect of triclosan on both soybean and oat plants by enhancing their biomass, photosynthesis, as well as levels of minerals (K, Ca, P, Mn, and Zn). In parallel, a striking quenching in oxidative damage and an obvious improvement in non-enzymatic (polyphenols, tocopherols, flavonoids) and enzymatic antioxidants were observed. Furthermore, Salinicoccus sp.

The use of nanomaterials is currently the most important field of research in surface treatment technology for the preservation of building materials and, more specifically, to improve their durability and prevent their deterioration, extending their useful life. This paper studies the influence of a graphene oxide (GO) suspension as a surface treatment on the properties of concrete. The results indicate that, at best, surface treatment with GO can decrease both the water absorption and capillary absorption of concrete by about 15\u00a0%. The increase in the amount of GO deposited as a surface treatment leads to a further reduction in concrete water absorption. It is shown that, at best, GO coating also reduces water penetration at low and high pressures by approximately 20\u00a0% and 60\u00a0%, respectively. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that GO surface treatment facilitates the hydration process and densifies the concrete microstructure.

However, most existing solutions primarily focus on managing symptoms, with limited attention given to proactively preventing the underlying pathological processes. To address this challenge, we conducted a drug screening focusing on clinically-relevant polyphenolic compounds, given the growing interest in polyphenolic compounds for their potential role in tissue repair during wound healing. This screening led to the identification of resveratrol as the most promising candidate for mitigating tracheal complications, as it exhibited the most significant efficacy in enhancing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) while concurrently suppressing the pivotal fibrosis factor: transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), showcasing its robust potential in addressing these issues. Building upon this discovery, we further developed an innovative photosensitive poly-L-lysine gel integrated with a resveratrol-magnesium metal polyphenol network (MPN), named Res-Mg/PL-MA. This design allows for the enables sustained release of resveratrol and synergistically enhances the expression of VEGF and also promotes resistance to tensile forces, aided by magnesium ions, in an anastomotic tracheal fistula animal models. Moreover, the combination of resveratrol and poly-L-lysine hydrogel effectively inhibits bacteria, reduces local expression of key inflammatory factors, and induces polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as well as inhibits TGF-\u03b21, consequently decreasing collagen production levels in an animal model of post-tracheal resection. In summary, our novel Res-Mg/PL-MA hydrogel, through antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and pro-vascularization mechanisms, effectively prevents complications at tracheal anastomosis, offering significant promise for translational applications in patients undergoing tracheal surgeries.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "29"}}, {"article_title": "Longitudinal associations between social support and sarcopenia: findings from a 5-year cohort study in Chinese aged \u226550 years.", "article_abstract": "We aimed to investigate longitudinal associations of overall social support and its sub-domains with risk of sarcopenia and its related traits in community-dwelling Chinese aged \u2265 50 years.

Methods After obtaining ethical committee approval, a retrospective closed cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent cesarean with GA and RA. This study was conducted at a tertiary-level university hospital in Oman from January 2015 to December 2019. The investigators collected maternal and fetal data (hypotension, bradycardia, blood loss, APGAR score, fetal mortality, complications, and length of stay) from January 2015 to December 2019. The primary<i>\u00a0outcome</i> was the incidence of intraoperative hypotension, and the secondary<i>\u00a0outcomes</i> studied were significant blood loss and APGAR score in both anesthesia techniques. Results A total of 2500 cesarean patients were studied, of whom 1379 received RA and 1121 received GA. The overall hypotension (systolic BP<90 mm Hg) rate observed was 40.1%; it was significantly lower with GA as compared to RA (32.1% versus 46.5%, respectively, <i>P</i><0.001, OR 0.545, 95% CI 0.462 to 0.643).

Surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified a 20-mm-sized reddish depressed lesion in a diverticulum in the middle esophagus. The lesion was confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma by biopsy. Magnification endoscopy with narrow-band imaging showed intraepithelial papillary capillary loops of type B1 according to the magnified endoscopic classification of the Japan Esophageal Society. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed the presence of the muscular layer of the esophagus wall in the diverticulum. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as SEC, confined to the epithelium or lamina propria mucosae, in a Rokitansky diverticulum. Based on these findings, ESD was considered technically feasible. Traction-assisted ESD using clip with line was performed, and en bloc resection was achieved without adverse events. The resected specimen pathologically revealed a squamous cell carcinoma confined to the lamina propria mucosae without lymphovascular invasion, suggesting a curative resection. The patient recovered well, and no recurrence has been observed for 5\u2009years after the ESD. Whether ESD is appropriate for the treatment of SEC in a diverticulum remains unclear.

In such surgeries, the reconstruction of the skull base is crucial for surgical success and minimizing complications. This study presents a new side-support surgical tray designed to improve the exposure of the lateral femoral surgical area during surgery, enhancing surgical efficiency and reducing the risk of surgical complications. The study compared this innovative tray stand with the conventional double-sided support tray stand to evaluate its impact on surgical procedures and complications. Materials and methods The study prospectively analyzed 248 endoscopic transnasal skull base surgeries requiring lateral femoral autologous tissue harvesting. One hundred fifty-eight cases were performed using the side-support surgical tray stand (experimental group), while 90 cases used the conventional double-sided support tray stand (control group). Various parameters were evaluated, including satisfaction scores of surgeons, circulating nurses, instrument nurses, and anesthetists, as well as objective outcomes such as surgical duration and the incidence of complications. Results Surgeons in the experimental group expressed higher satisfaction with the surgical field exposure and the portability of the surgical tray stand compared to the control group. Likewise, circulating nurses in the experimental group reported greater satisfaction with the installation and portability, surpassing that of the control group (<i>p</i>< 0.01). Although the stability of instrument nurses in the experimental group was slightly less than that of the control group, it had no discernible impact on surgical cooperation. Anaesthesiologists in the experimental group exhibited higher satisfaction regarding the convenience of intraoperative monitoring and management than their counterparts in the control group. The average duration required for intraoperative autologous tissue harvesting in the experimental group was significantly shorter than in the control group (<i>p</i>\u00a0< 0.01).

However, there have not been any comprehensive studies on forensic entomology and its usage in forensic inquiry specific to the region, especially Kerala, India. The insect succession on decomposed animal matter plays an important role in estimating minimum postmortem intervals (mPMI). Objective The purpose of the study was to\u00a0understand forensically important insect groups and their role in the decomposition process of dead decaying\u00a0matter. The different decomposition stages of a corpse vary in attraction to necrophagous insects and the insect fauna depending on its prevailing conditions of decay. The decomposition is highly dependent on the exposition of animal matter and abiotic and biotic factors acting on it. The main objective of the present investigation was to identify the insect fauna associated with decaying chicken liver. The study also envisages comprising the diversity and abundance of insects between two different treatments of animal matter: in contact with soil and controlled conditions in a clean basin. Method The study was conducted for 45 days (until the total decomposition of the samples in both conditions) during the pre-monsoon months of April to May\u00a02022 at Chalikadavu, Muvattupuzha, in the Ernakulam district, Kerala, India. The samples were however kept away from direct sunlight and rain to avoid the direct impact on the orienting fauna. The entomofauna found to be associated with the decaying animal matter was carefully collected from the site and stored in 70% isopropyl alcohol for preservation. The total number of insects was recorded along with the hours of maximum incidence, and samples were stored in plastic vials for further identification. Result In this study, we analyzed the activities of ants, mites, wasps, cockroaches, moths, beetles, and flies during the decomposition of decaying chicken liver. Among these insects, flies and beetles are two important arthropod communities associated with animal matter decomposition. We collected these foraging organisms for morpho-taxonomic identification.

In this work, copyrolysis of polystyrene and biomass was passed to a second-stage dielectric barrier discharge nonthermal plasma reactor with the aim to further improve the product bio-oil. Pyrolysis of the polystyrene and biomass produces volatiles that pass to the second stage to undergo cracking and autohydrogenation reactions under nonthermal plasma conditions. There was a synergistic interaction between biomass and polystyrene in terms of overall oil and gas yield and composition even in the absence of the nonthermal plasma. However, the introduction of the nonthermal plasma produced a marked increase in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., ethylbenzene), whereas polycyclic aromatic compounds decreased in concentration. Most notably, the influence of the plasma markedly reduced the quantity of oxygenated compounds in the product oil.

Mating signals are also often underpinned by physiological, morphological, and behavioural adaptations, which may require the evolution of novelty, but the genetic basis in many cases is unknown. In orchid bees, males acquire chemical compounds from the environment that act as pheromone-like bouquets (perfumes) during courtship displays. This process could be costly, potentially due to the cognitive demands of learning and the physiological demands of collecting a mix of extrinsic chemical compounds that may require detoxification. Furthermore, a novel trait, a specialized perfume pouch in the hind leg, is required for compound storage. We studied gene expression in the brain, hind leg, and Malpighian tubules-a tissue involved in detoxification-to investigate changes in gene expression following perfume collection. We detected upregulation of genes enriched in functions related to transcription, odorant binding, and receptor activity in the Malpighian tubules. On the other hand, we did not find any evidence for learning processes following perfume collection, or gene expression changes in the hind leg, perhaps due to constitutive expression, or the age of the sampled bees.

This adjustment made to the funnels have effectively mitigated critical clogging problems frequently encountered in density separation units. An experiment was conducted using sand-based sediment spiked with polyamide fragments to validate this method modification. Following a complete extraction protocol with the modification of separating funnels, the microplastic extraction efficiency from sediments was high with a 90% recovery rate.

To address this challenge, we introduce the joint\u00a0masking and\u00a0self-supervised\u00a0(JMSS)-MMA model. This model synergizes graph autoencoders with a probability distribution-based masking strategy, effectively countering the impact of noisy data and enabling precise predictions of unknown MMAs.

Our masking strategy has successfully reduced data noise, enhancing prediction accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering integration of a masking strategy with graph autoencoders for MMA prediction. Furthermore, the JMSS-MMA model incorporates a node-degree-based decoder, deepening the understanding of the network's structure.

An agricultural system based on free-threshing cereals (naked wheat and naked barley) seems to shift to one based on glume wheats. This is a major change for traditional farmers and this paper aims to shed light on its possible causes. Here we describe the results of new investigations in a key area for the understanding of this process: the NW Mediterranean arch, where free-threshing cereals are the main cultivars since ca. 5100 BC. New data confirm that the shift towards glume wheats is also observed in some sites of the NE of the Iberian Peninsula and that among the glume wheats that spread at ca. 4000 BC we should not only consider emmer and einkorn but also Timopheevi's wheat. Stable isotope analyses indicate no major decrease in soil fertility or alterations in local precipitation regimes. The agricultural change may be the result of a combination of the spread of damaging pests for free-threshing cereals and presumably new networks being developed with the North-eastern part of Italy and the Balkans.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "04"}}, {"article_title": "Refining reconstructive arsenal: Free omental flap with autologous bone graft for complex craniofacial defects after tumor resection and frontal osteoradionecrosis.", "article_abstract": "Skull osteoradionecrosis may happen after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

This difficulty can be overcome using behavioral modeling, which is when mathematical models are constructed according to the input-output relationships on the input and output signals. For memristor modeling, piecewise neural and polynomial models with split signals are proposed. At harmonic input signals of memristors, this study suggests that split signals should be formed using a delay line. This method produces the minimum number of split signals and, as a result, simplifies behavioral models. Simplicity helps reduce the dimension of the nonlinear approximation problem solved in behavioral modeling. Based on the proposed method, the piecewise neural and polynomial models with harmonic input signals were constructed to approximate the transfer characteristic of the memristor, in which the current dynamics are described using the Bernoulli differential equation.

The influences of distinct geometric parameters and operating conditions on thermal resistance are investigated. The results show that the thermal resistances of NC-cool and CE-cool are almost the same as each other. Decreasing microchannel base thickness (<i>h<sub>b</sub></i>) significantly increases the thermal resistance of CE-cool, and when its thickness is less than a critical value, NC-cool exhibits superior cooling performance than CE-cool.

In a fiber laser system, the driver of a pumping source using a laser diode (LD) module and its dynamic control capability directly affect the performance of the fiber laser system. The commercial design of pumping source drivers for high-power fiber lasers is mainly based on a linear-type DC power supply, which has two major drawbacks, i.e., lower efficiency and bulk. In this regard, this paper proposes for the first time a new design approach with a programmable switching mode laser diode driver using a power semiconductor device (PSD)-based full-bridge phase-shifted (FB-PS) DC-DC converter for driving a 200 W optical power laser diode module. In this paper, the characteristics of a laser diode module and the system configuration of the proposed laser diode driver are first introduced. Then, a current control scheme using the concept of phase angle shifting to achieve a fast dynamic current tracking feature is explained. The proposed current control technique with a fully digital control scheme is then addressed. Next, dynamic mathematical models of the laser diode driver system and controllers are derived, and the quantitative design detail of the controller is presented. To confirm the correctness of the proposed control scheme, a simulation study on a typical control case is performed in PSIM 9.1 software environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed LD driver, a digital signal processor is then used as the control core to construct a hardware prototype implementation for performing experimental tests.

However, the complexity of the entire manufacturing procedure and the various microstructures of 3D microelectronic products significantly intensified the risk of product failure due to fabrication defects. To respond to this challenge, this work presents a defect detection technology based on deep learning and machine vision for real-time monitoring of the AM fabrication process.

In this article, we present a test bench we have developed to age and measure the degradation of 5103 ring oscillators (ROs) implemented in nine FPGAs with 16nm FinFET under different temperature and voltage conditions (Vnom\u2264Vstress\u22641.3Vnom and 25\u00b0C\u2264Tstress\u2264115\u00b0C) close to operational conditions in order to predict reliability regarding degradation mechanisms at the transistor scale (BTI, HCI and TDDB) as realistically as possible. By comparing our initial RO measurements and the data extracted from Vivado, we will show that the performance of the nine FPGAs is between 50% and 70% of the best performance expected by Vivado. After 8000 h of ageing, we will see that the relative degradations of the RO are a maximum of 1%, which is a first indicator proving the FPGAs' good reliability. By comparing our results with similar studies on 28 nm MOSFET FPGAs, we will reveal that 16 nm FinFET FPGAs are more reliable. To be implemented in an FPGA, an RO uses logic resources (LUT) and routing resources. We will show that degradation in the two types of resources is different. For this reason, we will present a method for separating degradations in logical and routing resources based on RO degradation measures.

Nowadays, they are mainly synthetically produced by wet reactions using CaCO<sub>3</sub> reagents in the presence of stabilizers. However, it has recently been discovered that ACC can be produced by ball milling calcite. Calcite and/or aragonite are the mineral phases of mollusk shells, which are formed from ACC precursors. Here, we investigated the possibility to convert, on a potentially industrial scale, the biogenic CaCO<sub>3</sub> (bCC) from waste mollusk seashells into nanocrystalline CaCO<sub>3</sub> and ACC. Waste seashells from the aquaculture species, namely oysters (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>, low-Mg calcite), scallops (<i>Pecten jacobaeus</i>, medium-Mg calcite), and clams (<i>Chamelea gallina</i>, aragonite) were used. The ball milling process was carried out by using different dispersing solvents and potential ACC stabilizers. Structural, morphological, and spectroscopic characterization techniques were used. The results showed that the mechanochemical process produced a reduction of the crystalline domain sizes and formation of ACC domains, which coexisted in microsized aggregates. Interestingly, bCC behaved differently from the geogenic CaCO<sub>3</sub> (gCC), and upon long milling times (24 h), the ACC reconverted into crystalline phases. The aging in diverse environments of mechanochemically treated bCC produced a mixture of calcite and aragonite in a species-specific mass ratio, while the ACC from gCC converted only into calcite. In conclusion, this research showed that bCC can produce nanocrystalline CaCO<sub>3</sub> and ACC composites or mixtures having species-specific features.

Distinct from conventional studies that have focused on the bottom, dense phase of coacervates, this research emphasizes the top, dilute phase, low-viscous coacervate liquid termed liquid-VATA (<i>l</i>-VATA). Due to TA's capability of intermolecular association as well as adhesiveness, phenomena not typically observed in the upper dilute phase of standard polyelectrolyte-based coacervates are revealed. At first glance, the dilute phase <i>l</i>-VATA coacervate resembles a water-like, low-viscous mixture solution of PVA, TA, and PVA/TA complexes. However, analysis shows that nearly all of the TA molecules associate with PVA chains, forming PVA/TA complexes. Furthermore, supraparticular association was observed between PVA/TA complex nanoparticles upon applying external shear force. A broad survey of shear rate and strain showed that the solution exhibited sequential shear-thickening, followed by shear-thinning behavior. The water-like, low viscosity of <i>l</i>-VATA unexpectedly reveals robust adhesiveness and thus able to lift an entire mouse using just a single human hair strand. Even in cases of failure, no interfacial failure was detected between mouse and human hair. In addition to enabling hair-to-hair bonding, our study also showcases the efficacy of <i>l</i>-VATA in facilitating hair-to-skin adhesion. The results illustrate how the lower viscosity of <i>l</i>-VATA can be exploited for a wide range of industrial and cosmetic applications, allowing the formulation of thin, uniform adhesive layers, something unachievable with the dense, viscous VATA glue.

ALS is variable regarding presentation, disease progression, genetic profile and patient reaction to the diagnosis. It is obviously important to exclude treatable conditions but, in most patients, for experienced neurologists the diagnosis is clear-cut, depending on the presence of progressive upper and lower motor neuron signs. Patients with signs of restricted lower motor neuron (LMN) or upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction may present diagnostic difficulty, but electromyography (EMG) is often a determinant diagnostic test since it may exclude other disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation may aid detection of UMN dysfunction, and brain and spinal cord MRI, ultrasound and blood neurofilament measurements, have begun to have clinical impact, although none are themselves diagnostic tests. Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in the past; all rely on clinical LMN and UMN signs in different anatomic territories, EMG changes, exclusion of other disorders, and disease progression, in particular evidence of spreading to other anatomic territories. Fasciculations are a characteristic clinical feature and increased importance is now attached to fasciculation potentials detected by EMG, when associated with classical signs of denervation and reinnervation. The Gold Coast diagnostic criteria rely on the presence of UMN and LMN signs in one (or more) anatomic territory, or LMN signs in two (or more) anatomic territories, recognizing the fundamental clinical requirements of disease progression and exclusion of other diseases. Recent studies confirm a high sensitivity without loss of specificity using these Gold Coast criteria. In considering the diagnosis of ALS a critical question for future understanding is whether ALS should be considered a syndrome or a specific clinico-pathologic entity; this can only be addressed in the light of more complete knowledge.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "19"}}, {"article_title": "High-Sensitivity Detection of Changes in Local Refractive Index and Absorption by Analyzing WGM Microlaser Emission via a 2D Dispersion Spectrometer.", "article_abstract": "Microlasers have been widely used in biosensing applications because of their high sensitivity to changes in local conditions.

However, the links between traits and demographic rates are, in general, not as strong as expected. These weak associations may be due to the use of traits that are distantly related to performance, and/or the lack of consideration of size-related variations in both traits and demographic rates. Here, we examined how wood traits were related to demographic rates in 19 tree species from a lowland forest in eastern Amazonia. We measured 11 wood traits (i.e. structural, anatomical and chemical traits) in sapling, juvenile and adult wood; and related them to growth and mortality rates (MR) at different ontogenetic stages. The links between wood traits and demographic rates changed during tree development. At the sapling stage, relative growth rates (RGR) were negatively related to wood specific gravity (WSG) and total parenchyma fractions, while MR decreased with radial parenchyma fractions, but increased with vessel lumen area (<i>V</i><sub>A</sub>). Juvenile RGR were unrelated to wood traits, whereas juvenile MR were negatively related to WSG and axial parenchyma fractions. At the adult stage, RGR scaled with <i>V</i><sub>A</sub> and wood potassium concentrations. Adult MR were not predicted by any trait. Overall, the strength of the trait-demography associations decreased at later ontogenetic stages. Our results indicate that the associations between traits and demographic rates can change as trees age. Also, wood chemical or anatomical traits may be better predictors of growth and MR than WSG.

The secondary outcomes were postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (iv-PCA) suspension, and postoperative complications. Results No significant differences were observed in the characteristics, NRS scores, time to first drug use for pain, and iv-PCA suspension between groups. However, the incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the post-SNB group (p = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis revealed that droperidol doses of iv-PCA and the presence of postoperative SNB were independently associated with PONV occurrence [A1]\u00a0{(p = 0.008, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [0.46, 0.89] and (p = 0.02, 95% CI [0.25, 0.88])}.

This study explores the role of genetic variations in blood group antigens, particularly ABO and RhD, in shaping mortality rates among critically ill COVID-19 patients in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Methods Utilizing a retrospective, noninterventional approach, we analyzed medical records of 594 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Aseer Central Hospital from August 2020 to April 2021. The cohort, with a mean age of 60.5 years, consisted of a predominantly male population. Results The study encompassed a diverse age range of 18 to 103 years, with a mean age of 60.5 \u00b1 17.3 years. Of the 594 patients, 398 (67%) were male, and only 5 (0.8%) had a history of smoking. Blood group distribution revealed 275 (48.4%) with O-, 189 (33.3%) with A+, and 51 (9%) with AB- types. Predominant chronic conditions included diabetes mellitus (35.5%). Tragically, 320 patients (54.6%) experienced mortality, with a 100% mortality rate for the B+ blood group and 92.9% for O- blood group. Conclusion This analysis establishes significant statistical links, underscoring the pivotal role of blood type, particularly the Rh factor, in influencing mortality risk among critically ill COVID-19 patients.

With the primary optimization goal of reducing pressure loss, the study compares simulation outcomes of various flow channel models-linear, variable excessive radius, and the multidimensional Bessel curve-tailored to suit the arrangement specifics of the joint HDU. Further validating these designs, the flow channels are fabricated using additive manufacturing for experimental verification. The integration of simulation analyses and pressure loss testing reveals a remarkable reduction of over 40% in pressure loss for the bionic flow channel compared to the conventional machining form. This empirical evidence strongly substantiates the bionic flow channel's superior efficacy in pressure loss reduction. The findings presented herein offer valuable insights for the development of low-loss flow channels in joint HDUs, thereby presenting a new avenue for designing energy-efficient, high power-to-weight ratio legged robots.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "31"}}, {"article_title": "Qubit Adoption Method of a Quantum Computing-Based Metaheuristics Algorithm for Truss Structures Analysis.", "article_abstract": "Since the mention of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2016, quantum computers and quantum computing (QC) have emerged as key technologies. Many researchers are trying to realize quantum computers and quantum computing. In particular, most of the development and application of metaheuristics algorithms using quantum computing is focused on computer engineering fields. Cases in which the developed algorithm is applied to the optimal design of a building or the optimal design results presented by expanding the algorithm in various directions are very insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed four methods of adopting qubits to perform pitch adjusting in the optimization process of the QbHS (quantum-based harmony search) algorithm and applied it to TTO (truss topology optimization) using four methods to compare the results. The four methods of adopting qubits have the same or decreased number of qubits adopted as the number of iterations changes. As a result of applying TTO using four methods, convergence performance differed depending on the adoption method, and convergence performance was superior to conventional HS (harmony search) algorithms in all methods. The optimal design of structural engineering using such QC is expected to contribute to the revitalization of future technologies in the architectural field and the field of computer information systems.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "bioGWAS: A Simple and Flexible Tool for Simulating GWAS Datasets.", "article_abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of genetic susceptibility loci affecting human complex traits.

Simulation of GWAS results is a powerful method that may provide such datasets and facilitate the development of new methods. In this work, we developed bioGWAS, a simple and flexible pipeline for the simulation of genotypes, phenotypes, and GWAS summary statistics. Unlike existing methods, bioGWAS can be used to generate GWAS results for simulated quantitative and binary traits with a predefined set of causal genetic variants and/or molecular pathways. We demonstrate that the proposed method can recapitulate complete GWAS datasets using a set of reported genome-wide associations.

Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) holds immense potential in achieving fine-grained access control, providing robust security for electronic healthcare data in the cloud. However, current CP-ABE schemes still face issues such as inflexible attribute revocation, relatively lower computational capabilities, and key management. To address these issues, this paper introduces a revocable and traceable undeniable ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption scheme (MA-RUABE). MA-RUABE not only enables fast and accurate data traceability, effectively preventing malicious user key leakage, but also includes a direct revocation feature, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of a multi-permission mechanism resolves the issue of centralization of power caused by single-attribute permissions. Furthermore, a security analysis demonstrates that our system ensures resilience against chosen plaintext attacks.

Consequently, the analysis of time-domain signals and the utilization of artificial intelligence, including deep learning methods, have emerged as pivotal approaches for addressing these challenges. Although deep learning is widely used for pneumatic valve fault diagnosis, the success of most deep learning methods depends on a large amount of labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis method based on the attention-weighted relation network (AWRN) is proposed to achieve fault detection and classification with small sample data. In the proposed method, fault diagnosis is performed through the relation network in few-shot learning, and in order to enhance the representativeness of feature extraction, the attention-weighted mechanism is introduced into the relation network. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the method, a DA valve fault dataset is constructed, and experimental validation is performed on this dataset and another benchmark PU rolling bearing fault dataset. The results show that the accuracy of the network on DA is 99.15%, and the average accuracy on PU is 98.37%.

These can cause gene disruption and large-scale genomic alterations, including inversions, deletions, and duplications. Host organisms have evolved a set of mechanisms to suppress TE activity and counter the threat that they pose to genome integrity. These includes the epigenetic silencing of TEs mediated by a process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In most cases, the silencing machinery is very efficient for the vast majority of TEs. However, there are specific circumstances in which TEs can evade such silencing mechanisms, for example, a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses or in vitro culture. Hybridization is also proposed as an inductor of TE proliferation. In fact, the discoverer of the transposons, Barbara McClintock, first hypothesized that interspecific hybridization provides a \"genomic shock\" that inhibits the TE control mechanisms leading to the mobilization of TEs. However, the studies carried out on this topic have yielded diverse results, showing in some cases a total absence of mobilization or being limited to only some TE families.

When cells are transfected with HERV-W FMG, they can fuse with neighboring cells expressing the receptor, resulting in the formation of syncytia. These syncytia eventually undergo cell death within a few days. In addition, it has been observed that an HERV-W env mutant, which is truncated after amino acid 483, displays increased fusogenicity compared to the wild-type HERV-W env. In this study, we observed syncytium formation upon transfection of HeLa and TE671 human cancer cells with plasmids containing the HERV-W 483 gene. To explore the potential of a semi-replication-competent retroviral (s-RCR) vector encoding HERV-W 483 for FMG-mediated cancer gene therapy, we developed two replication-defective retroviral vectors: a gag-pol vector encoding HERV-W 483 (MoMLV-HERV-W 483) and an env vector encoding VSV-G (pCLXSN-VSV-G-EGFP). When MoMLV-HERV-W 483 and pCLXSN-VSV-G-EGFP were co-transfected into HEK293T cells to produce the s-RCR vector, gradual syncytium formation was observed.

Wheat plants were grown under a 16 h photoperiod (light intensity 150 \u03bcmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>) for 4 weeks at 22 \u00b0C and 60% humidity with 6 different treatments, including control, Mo, and Cu exposure through root and leaf. The exposure dose was 6.25 mg of element per plant through either root or leaf. An additional low-dose (0.6 mg Mo/plant) treatment of Mo through root was added after phytotoxicity was observed. Using targeted proteomics approach, 24 proteins involved in 12 metabolomic pathways were quantitated to understand the regulation at the protein level. Mo exposure, particularly through root uptake, induced significant upregulation of 16 proteins associated with 11 metabolic pathways, with the fold change (FC) ranging from 1.28 to 2.81. Notably, a dose-dependent response of Mo exposure through the roots highlighted the delicate balance between nutrient stimulation and toxicity as a high Mo dose led to robust protein upregulation but also resulted in depressed physiological measurements, while a low Mo dose resulted in no depression of physiological measurements but downregulations of proteins, especially in the first leaf (0.23 < FC < 0.68) and stem (0.13 < FC < 0.68) tissues. Conversely, Cu exposure exhibited tissue-specific effects, with pronounced downregulation (18 proteins involved in 11 metabolic pathways) particularly in the first leaf tissues (root exposure: 0.35 < FC < 0.74; leaf exposure: 0.49 < FC < 0.72), which indicated the quick response of plants to Cu-induced stress in the early stage of exposure.

However, several factors, especially the location and thickness of the tooth structures, such as enamel and dentine, can affect the result of an electric pulp test. Further, these factors also alter the pain threshold, which may lead to an inaccurate diagnosis. Hence, it is crucial to ascertain the optimal tooth surface that requires minimal time to elicit a response and pain threshold to enhance the effectiveness of the electric pulp tester for diagnosing the status of the pulp. Methods Fifty volunteers (36 males and 14 females) aged 18 to 32 years without any prior experience with the EPT were recruited. The EPT was placed on the seven premolar sites, and molar teeth with an appropriate electrolyte as a conducting medium were tested. The pain threshold values were recorded using the stopwatch, whereas pain assessment was carried out using the Memojis pain scale. An independent sample t-test and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data statistically. Results The buccal occlusal third in males (27.3\u00b18.6 seconds) and the buccal middle third in females (28.5\u00b18.2 seconds) showed lower response times than other sites in premolar teeth. The mesiobuccal cusp showed a lower response time for males (21.3\u00b16.6 seconds) and females (21.5\u00b16.2 seconds) in molar teeth. Of all the various sites tested, the majority of the individuals chose pain scores of 0 (36 in premolars, 84 in molars), two (138 in premolars, 180 in molars), and four (96 in premolars, 42 in molars) in both the premolars and molars. Conclusion The ideal sites for placing the EPT in premolars for males and females are the buccal occlusal third and the buccal middle third. At the same time, the mesiobuccal cusp is the ideal site for molars in both males and females, as it is responded to the quickest by the electric current. Most individuals have experienced a score of two (hurts a little bit) for the perceived pain using EPT for both the molars and premolars.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "18"}}, {"article_title": "Occlusal Contact Surface Changes and Occlusal Force Distribution Between Vacuum-Formed Retainers and Other Retainers: A Systematic Review.", "article_abstract": "The present systematic review was done to assess the available literatures on changes in the number of occlusal contacts (NOC), occlusal contact surface areas, and occlusal force distribution (OFD) with vacuum-formed retainers (VFRs) or clear overlay retainers during retention and to compare them with other retainers.

Pain and swelling that is associated with this procedure is a frequent reason for the patient's discomfort and apprehension. There is a need to look for a drug that can substantially reduce postoperative swelling amongst the patients. Pain, swelling, and trismus are common complications that are encountered after third molar surgery. These complications have a major impact on the quality of life of patients undergoing minor surgical procedures. Aim The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of coumarin and trypsin/chymotrypsin\u00a0in the reduction of postoperative sequelae for mandibular third molar surgeries. Materials and methods The research was carried out at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The study consisted of 50 individuals, 25 individuals received tablets of coumarin, and 25 individuals received tablets containing a combination of trypsin/chymotrypsin postoperatively. Patients were evaluated postoperatively for pain and swelling.

Central to this process is the proinflammatory M1 adipose-tissue macrophages (ATMs) in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Notably, natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial regulator of ATMs since their cytokines induce ATM recruitment and M1 polarization. The importance of NK cells is shown by the strong increase in NK-cell numbers in eWAT, and by studies showing that removing and expanding NK cells respectively improve and worsen obesity-induced insulin resistance. It has been suggested that NK cells are activated by unknown ligands on obesity-stressed adipocytes that bind to NKp46 (encoded by Ncr1), which is an activating NK-cell receptor. This was supported by a study showing that NKp46-knockout mice have improved obesity-induced inflammation/insulin resistance. We therefore planned to use the NKp46-knockout mice to further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NKp46 mediates eWAT NK-cell activation in obesity. We confirmed that obesity increased eWAT NKp46<sup>+</sup> NK-cell numbers and NKp46 expression in wild-type mice and that NKp46-knockout ablated these responses. Unexpectedly, however, NKp46-knockout mice demonstrated insulin resistance similar to wild-type mice, as shown by fasting blood glucose/insulin levels and glucose/insulin tolerance tests.\u00a0Obesity-induced increases in eWAT ATM numbers and proinflammatory gene expression were also similar. Thus, contrary to previously published results, NKp46 does not regulate obesity-induced insulin resistance. It is therefore unclear whether NKp46 participates in the development of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.

Macro-GES gives rise to genotype-by-environment interactions across definable and shared environments, while micro-GES causes heritable variation of phenotypes, e.g., the performance of progeny from one sire may be more variable than other sires. Yearling weight (YW) is a key trait in Australian Angus cattle that may be impacted by both macro- and micro-GES. Current models for genetic evaluation of YW attempt to account for macro-GES by fitting sire-by-herd interactions (S\u202f\u00d7\u202fH). Variation in micro-GES had not yet been estimated for YW in Australian Angus. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic variation due to macro- and micro-GES in YW of Australian Angus cattle. A reaction norm with contemporary group effects as the environmental covariate was fitted either as an alternative to or in combination with a random S\u202f\u00d7\u202fH effect to account for macro-GES. Double hierarchical generalised linear models (DHGLM), fitted as sire models, were used to estimate the genetic variance of the dispersion as a measure of micro-GES. Variation due to both macro- and micro-GES were found in YW. The variance of the slope of the reaction norm was 0.02-0.03 (SEs 0.00), while the S\u202f\u00d7\u202fH variance accounted for 7% of the phenotypic variance in all models.

The heritability of the dispersion on the measurement scale ranged from 0.06 to 0.10 (SEs 0.00) depending on which model was used. It should therefore be possible to alter both macro- and micro-GES of YW in Australian Angus through selection.

We examined thalamo-cortical evoked potentials (TCEPs) and cortical dynamics during stimulation of the DRTt. We recorded TCEPs in primary motor cortex during clinical and supra-clinical stimulation of the DRTt in ten essential tremor patients. Stimulation was varied over pulse amplitude (2-10\u00a0\u200bmA) and pulse width (30-250\u00a0\u200b\u03bcs) to allow for strength-duration testing. Testing at clinical levels (3\u00a0\u200bmA, 60\u00a0\u200b\u03bcs) for stimulation frequencies of 1-160\u00a0\u200bHz was performed and phase amplitude coupling (PAC) of beta phase and gamma power was calculated. Primary motor cortex TCEPs displayed two responses: early and all-or-none (<20\u00a0\u200bms) or delayed and charge-dependent (>50\u00a0\u200bms). Strength-duration curve approximation indicates that the chronaxie of the neural elements related to the TCEPs is <200\u00a0\u200b\u03bcs. At the range of clinical stimulation (amplitude 2-5\u00a0\u200bmA, pulse width 30-60\u00a0\u200b\u03bcs), TCEPs were not noted over primary motor cortex. Decreased pathophysiological phase-amplitude coupling was seen above 70\u00a0\u200bHz stimulation without changes in power spectra and below the threshold of TCEPs.

Annexin-A1 short peptide (ANXA1sp), with a molecular structure of Ac-Gln-Ala-Tyr, has been reported to exert an organ protective effect in the perioperative period by modulating sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Whether it possesses protective activity against sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy is worthy of study. This study aimed to investigate whether ANXA1sp exerts its anti-apoptotic effect in septic myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo via regulating SIRT3. In this study, we established in vivo and in vivo models of septic myocardial injury based on C57BL/6 mice and primary cardiomyocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. Results showed that ANXA1sp pretreatment enhanced the seven-day survival rate, improved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular fractional shortening (FS), and cardiac output (CO), and reduced the levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Western blotting results revealed that ANXA1sp significantly increased the expression of SIRT3, Bcl-2, and downregulated Bax expression. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry results showed that ANXA1sp could attenuate the apoptosis rate of cardiomyocytes, whereas this anti-apoptotic effect was significantly attenuated after SIRT3 knockout.

Primary chemoresistance, relapse and acute and long-term toxicities to conventional myelosuppressive therapies still constitute significant challenges and emphasize the unmet need for effective targeted therapies. Years of scientific efforts have translated into extensive insights on the heterogeneous spectrum of genetics and oncogenic signaling pathways of AML and identified a subset of patients characterized by upregulation of HOXA and HOXB homeobox genes and myeloid ecotropic virus insertion site 1 (MEIS1). Aberrant HOXA/MEIS1 expression is associated with genotypes such as rearrangements in Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A-r), nucleoporin 98 (NUP98-r) and mutated nucleophosmin (NPM1c) that are found in approximately one third of children with AML. AML with upregulated HOXA/MEIS1 shares a number of molecular vulnerabilities amenable to recently developed molecules targeting the assembly of protein complexes or transcriptional regulators. The interaction between the nuclear scaffold protein menin and KMT2A has gained particular interest and constitutes a molecular dependency for maintenance of the HOXA/MEIS1 transcription program. Menin inhibitors disrupt the menin-KMT2A complex in preclinical models of KMT2A-r, NUP98-r and NPM1c acute leukemias and its occupancy at target genes leading to leukemic cell differentiation and apoptosis. Early-phase clinical trials are either ongoing or in development and preliminary data suggests tolerable toxicities and encouraging efficacy of menin inhibitors in adults with relapsed or refractory KMT2A-r and NPM1c AML. The Pediatric Acute Leukemia/European Pediatric Acute Leukemia (PedAL/EUPAL) project is focused to advance and coordinate informative clinical trials with new agents and constitute an ideal framework for testing of menin inhibitors in pediatric study populations. Menin inhibitors in combination with standard chemotherapy or other targeting agents may enhance anti-leukemic effects and constitute rational treatment strategies for select genotypes of childhood AML, and provide enhanced safety to avoid differentiation syndrome.

However, healthcare providers (HPs) in the US report lack of comfort in interacting with immigrant and refugee populations. Methods The authors, in partnership with the Midwest Consortium of Global Health Educators, developed an innovative,\u00a0interactive ethics curriculum within the Immigrant Partnership Advocacy and Curricular Kit (I-PACK). They sought to increase HPs' confidence in navigating complex encounters with immigrant families by teaching a relevant ethical framework, highlighting the importance of cultural humility, and equipping learners with an ethics tool (five-box Method) for use in clinical encounters. They piloted the curriculum during three\u00a0workshop sessions in 2020-2021, and this curriculum continues to be used nationally as a part of I-PACK. Results Pre- and post-session surveys indicated that\u00a0all participants (100%, n=22) reported acquisition of new skills/knowledge and 19 (86%) felt confident applying this to their clinical practice. The participants reported appreciation for an ethical framework with which to analyze cases, enjoyment of active participation in small group discussions, and utility of the five-box method tool. Some areas of improvement offered were to have more cases and more time dedicated to small-group discussions. Conclusions Given the success of the I-PACK ethics curriculum pilot, the authors plan to incorporate immigrant health cases in the general ethics training in medical school classes and pediatric residency training. Furthermore, they will advocate for the importance of including immigrant health ethics across graduate medical education, as fluency and competence in navigating the ethics of immigrant health are required to provide patient-centered, culturally informed care to all populations.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "04"}}, {"article_title": "5-Fluorouracil Neurotoxicity in a Patient With Normal Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Activity.", "article_abstract": "5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of colon cancer and other solid malignancies.

Neither fungus synthesized BPLA when grown in axenic culture.

Fungi may also harbor cryptic BGCs that are not associated with previously characterized molecules. We turned to the tools of Fungal Artificial Chromosomes (FAC)-Next-Gen-Sequencing (NGS) to understand how co-culture activated cryptic biosynthesis of BPLA and several related berkeleylactones and to further investigate the true biosynthetic potential of these two fungi. FAC-NGS enables the capture of BGCs as individual FACs for heterologous expression in a modified strain of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> (heterologous host, FAC-<i>An</i>HH).

The development of AAA involves the breakdown of elastic fibers (elastolysis), infiltration of inflammatory cells, and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the specific regulators governing these responses remain unknown. We previously demonstrated that Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (Crp3) sensitizes SMCs to apoptosis induced by stretching. Building upon this finding, we aimed to investigate the influence of Crp3 on elastolysis and apoptosis during AAA development. Using the elastase-CaCl<sub>2</sub> rat model, we observed an increase in Crp3 expression, aortic diameter, and a reduction in wall thickness in wild type rats. In contrast, Crp3<sup>-/-</sup> rats exhibited a decreased incidence of AAA, with minimal or no changes in aortic diameter and thickness. Histopathological analysis revealed the absence of SMC apoptosis and degradation of elastic fibers in Crp3<sup>-/-</sup> rats, accompanied by reduced inflammation and diminished proteolytic capacity in Crp3<sup>-/-</sup> SMCs and bone marrow-derived macrophages.

A multiparent population consisting of 10 F<sub>5</sub>-derived populations with a total of 1,115 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using \"Benning HP\" as the donor parent of the Danbaekkong high-protein allele. A new functional marker targeting the 321-bp insertion in the gene <i>Glyma.20g085100</i> was developed and used to track the Danbaekkong high-protein allele across the different populations and enable assessment of its effect and stability. Across all populations, the high-protein allele consistently increased the content, with an increase of 3.3% in seed protein. A total of 103 RILs were selected from the multiparent population for yield testing in five environments to assess the impact of the high-protein allele on yield and to enable the selection of new breeding lines with high protein and high yield.

However, associations specific to dynamic functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease are still largely unexplored. Understanding the association between gene expression in the brain and functional networks may provide useful information about the molecular processes underlying variations in impaired brain function. Given the potential of dynamic functional connectivity to uncover brain states associated with Alzheimer's disease, it is interesting to ask: How does gene expression associated with Alzheimer's disease map onto the <i>dynamic</i> functional brain connectivity? If genetic variants associated with neurodegenerative processes involved in Alzheimer's disease are to be correlated with brain function, it is essential to generate such a map. Here, we investigate how the relation between gene expression in the brain and dynamic functional connectivity arises from nodal interactions, quantified by their role in network centrality (i.e. the drivers of the metastability), and the principal component of genetic co-expression across the brain. Our analyses include genetic variations associated with Alzheimer's disease and also genetic variants expressed within the cholinergic brain pathways. Our findings show that contrasts in metastability of functional networks between Alzheimer's and healthy individuals can in part be explained by the two combinations of genetic co-variations in the brain with the confidence interval between 72% and 92%. The highly central nodes, driving the brain aberrant metastable dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, highly correlate with the magnitude of variations from two combinations of genes expressed in the brain. These nodes include mainly the white matter, parietal and occipital brain regions, each of which (or their combinations) are involved in impaired cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, our results provide evidence of the role of genetic associations across brain regions in asymmetric changes in ageing. We validated our findings on the same cohort using alternative brain parcellation methods.

The 2013 French MONALISA prospective cohort identified that women born in Africa has a 3-fold increase in the risk of maternal neonatal listeriosis. One of the largest <i>L. monocytogenes</i> outbreaks occurred in South Africa in 2017-2018 with over 1,000 cases. Moreover, recent findings identified <i>L. monocytogenes</i> in human breast milk in Mali and Senegal with its relative abundance positively correlated with severe acute malnutrition.

For that purpose, we searched the peer-reviewed and grey literature published dating back to 1926 to date using six databases. Ultimately, 225 articles were included in this review. We highlighted that <i>L. monocytogenes</i> is detected in various sample types including environmental samples, food samples as well as animal and human samples. These studies were mostly conducted in five east African countries, four west African countries, four north African countries, and two Southern African countries. Moreover, only \u2248 0.2% of the <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> genomes available on NCBI were obtained from African samples, contracted with its detection.

An eco-friendly and easy approach was used for the preparation of this novel adsorbent, the low cost, easy access to the used materials, and the simplicity of the preparation method are some of the interesting advantages of this work. Also, this prepared adsorbent was used as an adsorbent to remove diazinon organophosphate poison and tetracycline antibiotic from aqueous solutions. In order to confirm the prepared adsorbent structure, the CS@TDI@EDTA@\u03b3-AlO(OH) composite was investigated by various analyses including FT-IR, EDX, XRD, FESEM and TGA. The adsorption behavior of the adsorbent prepared for the removal of tetracycline and diazinon was investigated under different conditions by varying the concentration, temperature, the adsorbent dose, pH and contact time. Based on various tests, the highest diazinon adsorption capacity was obtained for 0.12\u00a0g/L adsorbent at pH 7 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C with 40\u00a0mg/L initial concentration. Also, the maximum adsorption capacity of the tetracycline was obtained for 0.12\u00a0g/L adsorbent at pH 9 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C with 30\u00a0mg/L initial concentration. The equilibrium results for diazinon and for tetracycline were in good accordance with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, respectively. Also, the highest adsorption capacities for diazinon at pH 7 and tetracycline at pH 9 were 1428.5 and 555.5\u00a0mg/g, respectively. Also the kinetic investigations revealed that the correlation factor (R<sup>2</sup>) of pseudo-second-order model obtained for the adsorption of diazinon and tetracycline was 0.9986 and 0.9988, while the coefficient k (g/mg.min) was 0.000084 and 0.0033, respectively. These results indicate that the adsorption of diazinon and tetracycline is pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Formation of hydrogen bonds between adsorbate and adsorbent as well as the high specific surface area and porosity of the adsorbent are the main mechanisms that contribute to the adsorption process. In addition, thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption of diazinon and tetracycline is a spontaneous endothermic process. The adsorbent prepared in this work was expected to have wide range of applications in wastewater treatment thanks to its good reusability in water and strong removal of diazinon and tetracycline compared to other adsorbents.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "09"}}, {"article_title": "Whole-course application of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean section: A randomized, controlled trial.", "article_abstract": "Dexmedetomidine is known to prolong the analgesic duration of spinal anesthesia, but it can be challenging to achieve further extension without opioids.

Following the restoration of blood flow post-tissue ischemia, oxidative stress can lead to various forms of cell death, including necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial role of mitochondrial dysfunction in I/R injury. Nevertheless, there remains much to be explored regarding the molecular signaling network governing cell death under conditions of oxidative stress. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a major component in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is closely involved in the regulation of cell death. In a cellular model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), which effectively simulates I/R injury <i>in vitro</i>, our study reveals that OGD/R induces VDAC1 oligomerization, consequently exacerbating cell death. Furthermore, we have revealed the translocation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) to the mitochondria, where it interacts with VDAC1 following OGD/R injury, leading to an increased mitochondrial membrane permeability. Notably, the inhibition of MLKL by necrosulfonamide hinders the binding of MLKL to VDAC1, primarily by affecting the membrane translocation of MLKL, and reduces OGD/R-induced VDAC1 oligomerization. Collectively, our findings provide preliminary evidence of the functional association between MLKL and VDAC1 in the regulation of necroptosis.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "11"}}, {"article_title": "Bases selection with pseudo-random functions in BB84 scheme.", "article_abstract": "Because the spectrum of services available in modern telecommunication networks is constantly expanding, security has become increasingly important.

At times, it could be extremely hard or not viable to solve these equations/inequations directly. The PE (principle of equivalence) is a commonly applied pragmatic method across multiple fields. PE transforms the initial equations/inequations into simplified equivalent equations/inequations that are more manageable to solve, allowing researchers to achieve their objectives. The problem-solving process in many fields benefits from the use of PE. Recently, the ZE (Zhang equivalency) framework has surfaced as a promising approach for addressing time-dependent optimization problems. This ZEF (ZE framework) consolidates constraints at different tiers, demonstrating its capacity for the solving of time-dependent optimization problems. To broaden the application of ZEF in time-dependent optimization problems, specifically in the domain of motion planning for redundant manipulators, the authors systematically investigate the ZEF-I2I (ZEF of the inequation-to-inequation) type. The study concentrates on transforming constraints (i.e., joint constraints and obstacles avoidance depicted in different tiers) into consolidated constraints backed by rigorous mathematical derivations. The effectiveness and applicability of the ZEF-I2I are verified through two optimization motion planning schemes, which consolidate constraints in the velocity-tier and acceleration-tier. Schemes are required to accomplish the goal of repetitive motion planning within constraints.

Sulfuric acid was added to the toluene extract and the mixture was heated again. The lower layer in the test tube containing sulfuric acid was used for fluorescence measurements with excitation at 355 nm and measurement at 535 nm. The fluorometric Cuboni test revealed that the fluorescence counts in urine samples collected after the second trimester of gestation were significantly higher than those obtained from barren mares. The levels of estrogens, including equilin, estrone and estardiol-17\u03b2 exhibited a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence counts, whereas other steroids, such as progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol, did not affect fluorescence. Heat treatment of urine samples with hydrochloric acid significantly increased the fluorescence counts in those collected after the second trimester of gestation compared to non-pregnant samples, implying the presence of large amounts of conjugated estrogens in pregnant mare urine. Fluorescence counts in urine samples obtained during pregnancy showed a positive relationship with estrone concentrations as measured by enzyme immunoassay.

This study enrolled 36 severely obese patients who underwent LSG at our hospital from January 2020 to April 2022. As a pilot study, proteomic analysis was conducted on six patients using serum collected before and at 6 months after LSG, and significantly fluctuating proteins were extracted. Subsequently, verification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using collected serum was performed on the remaining 30 patients. The mean weight of enrolled patients was 118.5 kg. Proteomic analysis identified 1,912 proteins, many of which were related to the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Among these proteins, we focused on five TGF-\u03b2-related proteins: asporin, EMILIN-1, platelet factor-4, serglycin, and thrombospondin-1. Verification by ELISA revealed that asporin (p = 0.006) and thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.043) levels significantly fluctuated before and after LSG. Univariate analysis with a linear regression model showed that aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045), asporin (p = 0.011), and thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.022) levels were significantly associated with postoperative liver fibrosis. On multivariate analysis, asporin was an independent prognostic factor for postoperative liver fibrosis (95% confidence interval: 0.114-1.291, p = 0.002).

Remodeling takes place on bone surfaces, both on trabeculae and in the cortex, and serves the purposes of replacing old bone or that damaged by microfractures throughout the skeleton. The bone loss and consequent osteoporotic fractures that result from excess resorption over formation have mainly been prevented or treated by antiresorptive drugs that inhibit osteoclast formation and/or activity. Virtually all of the evidence leading to acceptance of antiresorptive drugs as treatment has depended upon their prevention of vertebral fractures. In recent decades, new prospects came of anabolic treatments that partly restore bone volume and microstructure restore bone that has been lost. The first of these was parathyroid hormone (PTH), shown by daily injection to increase markers of bone formation and prevent fractures. This field of interest enlarged with the discovery of PTH-related protein (PTHrP), so closely related in structure and action to PTH. The structural relationship between PTH and PTHrP is important in assessing their physiological and pharmacological roles, with the N-terminal domains of the 2 having virtually equal actions on target cells. Abaloparatide, a peptide analogue based on the structures of PTHrP and PTH, has been approved in some countries as a therapy for osteoporosis. Treatment through the PTH receptor activation pathway, and probably with any anabolic therapy, needs to be followed by antiresorptive treatment in order to maintain bone that has been restored. No matter how effective anabolic therapies for the skeleton become, it seems highly likely that there will be a continuing need for antiresorptive drugs.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "31"}}, {"article_title": "Blood and hoof\u00a0biodistibution of some trace element (Lithium, Copper, Zinc, Strontium and, Lead) in horse from two different areas of Sicily.", "article_abstract": "Biological monitoring of trace element horses is a well-known tool for investigating potential bioaccumulation in urbanized and industrialized geographical areas.

It has been suggested that the sensitivity of aquatic poikilothermal animals to climate change is closely related to mitochondrial function. Therefore, understanding the interaction between elevated temperature and mitochondrial functioning is key to characterizing organisms' responses to heat stress. However, little is known about the mitochondrial response to heat stress in A. japonicus. In this work, we investigated the morphological and functional changes of A. japonicus mitochondria under three representative temperatures, control temperature (18\u00a0\u00b0C), aestivation temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) and heat stress temperature (32\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of mitochondrial morphology combined with proteomics and metabolomics techniques. The results showed that the mitochondrial morphology of A. japonicus was altered, with decreases in the number of mitochondrial cristae at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and mitochondrial lysis, fracture, and vacuolization at 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses revealed 103 differentially expressed proteins and 161 differential metabolites at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. At 32\u00a0\u00b0C, the levels of 214 proteins and 172 metabolites were significantly altered. These proteins and metabolites were involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, substance transport, membrane potential homeostasis, anti-stress processes, mitochondrial autophagy, and apoptosis. Furthermore, a hypothetical network of proteins and metabolites in A. japonicus mitochondria in response to temperature changes was constructed based on proteomic and metabolomic data. These results suggest that the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, resistance to oxidative stress, autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial morphology in A. japonicus may play important roles in the response to elevated temperatures. In summary, this study describes the response of A. japonicus mitochondria to temperature changes from the perspectives of morphology, proteins, and metabolites, which provided a better understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation under environment stress in marine echinoderms.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Multi-biomarker combination detection system for diagnosis and classification of dry eye disease by imaging of a multi-channel metasurface.", "article_abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ocular surface diseases, characterized by unstable tear film and ocular inflammation, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of DED mainly relies on physical methods such as optical microscopy and ocular surface interferometric imaging, but classifying DED is still difficult. Here, we propose a compact and portable immune detection system based on the direct imaging of a nanophotonic metasurface with gradient geometry, for fast and ultra-sensitive detection of multiple biomarkers (i.e. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Lipocalin-1 (LCN-1), Lactoferrin (LTF)) in tears for the diagnosis and classification of DED. This centimeter-scale concentric nanophotonic metasurface, which consists of millions of unique metallic nanostructures, was fabricated through a cost-effective nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process. The immune detection system based on the antibody-modified metasurface shows favorable detection selectivity, an ultra-high sensitivity (3350 pixels/Refractive Index Unit (RIU)) and low limit of detection (LOD) (0.3\u00a0ng/mL for MMP-9, 1\u00a0ng/mL for LTF, and 0.5\u00a0ng/mL for LCN-1). Further clinical sampling and detection results demonstrated that this multi-biomarker detection system enabled accurate determination and symptom classification of DED, manifesting high correlation and consistency with clinical diagnosis results. The advantages such as low sample consumption, one-step detection, simple operation, and simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers make the platform promising for screening and detecting a broader range of biomarker combinations in clinical practice.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Personality traits as predictors for treatment response to sertraline among unmedicated obsessive-compulsive Disorder: A 12-weeks retrospective longitudinal study.", "article_abstract": "The effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a primary treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains uncertain. Even after undergoing standard SSRIs treatment, 40%-60% of individuals with OCD persistently endure symptoms. Recent studies proposed that personality traits may influence the diversity of OCD treatment results. Thus, in this retrospective study, we evaluated the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) scores of 51 untreated patients with OCD and 35 healthy controls. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was employed to assess OCD symptom severity at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of sertraline treatment. The primary outcome focused on the reduction rate of Y-BOCS scores (response: \u226525%; marked response: \u226550%). Our findings revealed that individuals with OCD demonstrated a significantly higher neuroticism score compared to healthy controls. Correlation analyses exposed a positive link between psychoticism and the duration of the disease. Moreover, family history strongly correlated with both obsessive thoughts and the total Y-BOCS score. Subsequent univariate Cox proportional analyses indicated that both low neuroticism and high extraversion traits could forecast the response to sertraline. Furthermore, only a high extraversion trait was linked to a marked response. Our results support the idea that personality traits may contribute to OCD vulnerability and predict sertraline treatment outcomes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "18"}}, {"article_title": "Dual task impact on functional mobility and interaction of functional level and balance in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.", "article_abstract": "Dystrophin, a protein crucial for various brain regions governing higher-order functions like learning and memory is notably absent in individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

However, there is an increasing concern about microplastic (MP) contamination of biosolids and their transport to terrestrial ecosystems. In Australia, agriculture is the largest biosolids end-user, however, there is limited understanding of MPs in Australian biosolids. Also, while the method to isolate MPs from biosolid is established, a need to extract and analyse MPs more efficiently is still pressing. In this study, we comprehensively quantified and characterised MPs in 146 biosolids samples collected from thirteen wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) including different seasons. We have optimised an oxidative-enzymatic purification method to overcome current limitations for MP identification in complex samples and accurately report MPs in biosolids. This method enabled removal of >93\u00a0% of dry weight of organic material and greatly facilitated the MPs instrumental analysis. The concentration of MPs (>20\u00a0\u00b5m) in all biosolids samples ranged from 11 to 150\u00a0MPs/g dry weight. Abundance of MPs was affected by seasons with higher abundance of MPs usually found during cold and wet seasons. Despite seasonal variations, polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane and polymethyl methacrylate were the most abundant polymers. Smaller MPs (20 to 200\u00a0\u00b5m) comprised >70\u00a0% of all detected MPs with a clear negative linear relationship observed between MP size and abundance. Per capita concentration of MPs in biosolids across all studied WWTPs was 0.7 to 21\u00a0g MPs per person per year. Therefore, biosolids are an important sink and source of MPs to agroecosystems, emphasising the need to more comprehensively understand the fate, impact and risks associated with MPs on agricultural soils.", "pub_date": {"year": "2023", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "Biological upcycling of nickel and sulfate as electrocatalyst from electroplating wastewater.", "article_abstract": "Upcycling nickel (Ni) to useful catalyst is an appealing route to realize low-carbon treatment of electroplating wastewater and simultaneously recovering Ni resource, but has been restricted by the needs for costly membranes or consumption of large amount of chemicals in the existing upcycling processes.
